    <h2>Willis Tower</h2>
    <img src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5037/e052/28ba/0d59/9b00/015a/medium_jpg/stringio.jpg?1414052877" alt="">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong>Willis Tower Skydeck, 233 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL, 60606</p>
    <p>Completed in 1973, the 1,450-foot tower is the undisputed king of the Windy City skyline. It held the title of the world’s tallest building for decades and maintained its claim to the highest roof in the Western Hemisphere up until last summer. Willis Tower is wrapping up a $500 million makeover which includes a new food hall, glass skylight, and revamped retail complex.</p>

  <div id="michigan">
    <h2>875 North Michigan</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/architecture-org/files/buildings/hancock-center-aaron-bean-pd.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong> 875 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL, 60611 </p>
    <p>Sharing many similarities with the Willis Tower, the SOM-designed skyscraper is perhaps the best example of structural expressionism. Rising 1,128 feet to the roof and nearly 1,500 feet to the tip of its twin antennas, the building was one of the tallest buildings in the world when it was completed in 1969. </p>

  <div id="aon">
    <h2>Aon Center</h2>
    <img src="https://www.enjoyillinois.com/assets/Tourism-Operators/images/itims/25071_f54e834d-beb4-d7f1-2802-ca053578323f.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>200 E Randolph St, Chicago, IL, 60601</p>
    <p>Originally known as the Standard Oil Building or “Big Stan,” Chicago’s third tallest skyscraper was later renamed the Amoco Building and, ultimately, the Aon Center. Completed in 1973, the monolithic office tower’s white facade was initially wrapped in 43,000 thin slabs of Italian Carrara marble. It was later re-clad in white granite after the marble started falling off the building and was deemed structurally unsafe. There’s also plans for a third observatory with a “thrill ride” and a glass elevator at 1,185 feet.</p>

  <div id="trib">
    <h2>Tribune Tower</h2>
    <img src="https://media1.fdncms.com/chicago/imager/u/original/23397864/miner-tower_without_tribune-magnum.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="600">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>435 Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60611</p>
    <p>The design of this famous skyscraper was the winning submission from John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood in a 1922 competition held by the Chicago Tribune newspaper. In addition to its notable neo-Gothic design, the structure features fragments from some the world's most famous structures—the Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Angkor Wat, and the Great Pyramids—embedded in its exterior. Big changes are coming to the landmark building as workers convert it into 162 luxury condos and a nearby supertall skyscraper.</p>

  <div id="wrigley">
    <h2>The Wrigley Building</h2>
    <img src="https://www.enjoyillinois.com/assets/Tourism-Operators/images/itims/24974_GP_Wrigley-Cropped-Hero-Shot.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="600">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>400-410 N Michigan Ave</p>
    <p>Built by the Wrigley Company in the early ’20s, the terra cotta complex actually consists of two buildings: a 30-story south tower connected to a 21-story north tower via a 14th-floor elevated walkway. The riverfront structure was also Chicago’s first air-conditioned office building.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="marina">
    <h2>Marina City</h2>
    <img src="https://images.skyscrapercenter.com/building/marinacity_ext-overall_(c)stevendahlmanphotography.jpg" alt="" height="700" width="500">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>Marina City, 300 N State St</p>
    <p>Designed by visionary architect Bertrand Goldberg and completed in 1968, Marina City was the original city-within-a-city development. Perched on the edge of the Chicago River, the Brutalist complex suddenly made it cool to live downtown and included innovative amenities for the time, such as an on-site grocery store, bowling alley, and marina. The towers’ famous corn cob shapes make them instantly recognizable.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="merch">
    <h2>Merchandise Mart</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/architecture-org/files/buildings/merchandise-mart-01-2.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="600">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>222 W Merchandise Mart Plaza</p>
    <p>Sporting its own zip code, the 4 million-square-foot Merchandise Mart was the biggest building in the world in terms of total floor area when it opened in 1930. The massive Art Deco structure has long housed many of Chicago’s home furnishing showrooms and has become a favorite among Chicago’s tech companies. In 2018, the city launched Art on the Mart, a massive multimedia video art display on the building’s facade.</p>

  <div id="opera">
    <h2>Civic Opera House</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/architecture-org/files/modules/ericallixrogers-lyric2018-web-10.jpg"  alt="" height="500" width="500">
    <img src="https://chicagology.com/wp-content/themes/revolution-20/chicagoimages/civicoperahousedrawing.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="750">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>20 N Upper Wacker Dr #400</p>
    <p>Resembling a giant armchair, Chicago’s 1929 Civic Opera House consists of a 45-story office tower flanked by two 22-story wings. The riverfront building boasts Art Deco ornamentation both inside and out and includes a performance space with 3,563 seats. The Civic Opera House is the second largest opera auditorium in the country behind New York’s Lincoln Center.</p>

  <div id="rook">
    <h2>The Rookery Building</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/architecture-org/files/buildings/rookery-eric-allix-rogers-09.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500">
    <img src="https://www.enjoyillinois.com/assets/Tourism-Operators/images/Rookery-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Interior-credit-Nick-Ulivieiri.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="750">
    <p class="address"><strong>Address: </strong>209 S LaSalle St</p>
    <p>The original design was by the legendary firm of Burnham & Root from the 1880s and an interior lobby renovation was then executed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1905. This early skyscraper is notable not only for its architectural pedigree, but also for being the oldest surviving high-rise in Chicago. Take a tour with the Chicago Architecture Center and get a glimpse of the landmark’s 11th-floor architects’ library.</p>
